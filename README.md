 SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF TWEETS REGARDING PEOPLE"S REACTION TO  LOCKDOWN ANNOUNCEMENTS
a. Overview
Sentiment analysis is the process of mining of patterns in texts in order to determine the sentiment or opinion being conveyed in the text. Using sentiment analysis, we can determine the emotion of the text being analyzed and “compute” the positivity, negativity or the neutrality of the tone of the text .Twitter, a popular micro blogging site, provides a huge amount of data regarding the   sentiments of people with respect to an event or a product.                           
 The analysis of sentiments of the tweets given out with respect to something can be used to identify the general opinion about it. Hence, sentiment analysis is widely used for consumer analysis and gaining insight into the workings of a society. This project aims to analyse the sentiments of the tweets put out by Indians regarding the COVID-19 lockdown in India and also build a model for predicting the future behaviour of Indian citizens and their emotions regarding the lockdown.


b.   Purpose
   The purpose of the project is to:
●     Perform sentiment analysis on the tweets about the pandemic lockdown in India
●     Build a predictive model to analyse the future behaviour of people in case of a lockdown extension


solution:
This model analyses the sentiments of tweets regarding the lockdown in India and using a predictive model, projects the behavior of people in the event of the extension of the lockdown.
The complete dataset is first obtained from Kaggle/IEEE data port and split into training and testing data. The training dataset is to be vectorized and then used to train models such as logistic regression, multinomial Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, random forest classifier. The polarities of the tweets under each model are also checked after which model testing is also done.
The predictive model, once built, can now be used for sentiment classification of tweets in real time by setting up and utilizing a Twitter API.
